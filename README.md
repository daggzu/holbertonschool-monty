Get Certified in C Programming for Free and Take Your Skills to the Next Level

After getting well-versed with linked lists and arrays in C, you are now ready to explore a new concept, that is stacks and queues. Both stacks and queues in C are data structures that can be implemented using either arrays or linked lists.

Newbies to programming often find it cumbersome to implement stacks and queues in C as it requires a thorough knowledge of all the concepts of C that we have covered so far. So, we will understand each and every important concept involved in stacks and queues in C in detail so that you would develop a clear understanding of the topic.

In this Stacks and Queues in C tutorial, we will discuss:

    Stack in C
    Array implementation of a Stack
    Linked list implementation of a Stack
    Applications of Stack
    Queue in C
    Array implementation of a Queue
    Linked list implementation of a Queue
    Circular Queue
    Applications of Queue

If we want to learn this concept then we have to go deep inside it. That’s why we are going to discuss its key topics, which will be helping us to grasp the concept in an efficient way. So let’s start –</p>
