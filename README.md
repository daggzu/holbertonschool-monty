## C - Stacks, Queues - LIFO, FIFO

#### DESCRIPTION 

####**Stack:**

- A Stack is a linear data structure that follows the LIFO principle, which stands for "Last In, First Out."
- The last element added to the stack is the first to be removed. Imagine a stack of plates: the last plate you place on top is the first to be removed.
- The fundamental operations on a stack are "push" (add an element) and "pop" (remove an element).
- Stacks are commonly used in a variety of applications, such as managing function calls in a call stack in programming or in back navigation in a web browser.

####**Queue:**

- A Queue is another linear data structure that follows the FIFO principle, which stands for "First In, First Out."
- This implies that the first element added to the queue is the first to be removed. Imagine a line of people waiting in a store: the first person to arrive is the first to be served.
- The basic operations on a queue are "enqueue" (add an element) and "dequeue" (remove an element).
- Queues are used in situations where it is important to maintain a specific order of items, such as in managing tasks in an operating system or printing documents on a printer.

####**Stacks and queues** 

They are data structures that are used to manage elements in a specific order. Stacks follow the LIFO principle, while queues follow the FIFO principle, and each has unique applications in solving programming problems and managing data in various situations.
